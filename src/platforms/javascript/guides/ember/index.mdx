On this page, we provide concise information to get you up and running with Sentry's Ember SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

**Note:** If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

Currently supports all lts versions of Ember 3.x

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. Add the Ember addon using ember-cli:

```bash
ember install @sentry/ember
```

## Configure

You should initialize the Sentry Ember SDK as soon as possible during your application load up, before initializing the
application in `app.js`:

```javascript
import Application from '@ember/application';
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver';
import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers';
import config from './config/environment';

import { InitSentryForEmber } from '@sentry/ember';

InitSentryForEmber();

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

Then add the following config to your `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  sentry: {
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  }
};
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

**Important:** Note your DSN. The _DSN_ (Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send events. If you forget it, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in the Sentry web UI.
