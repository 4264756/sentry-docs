On this page, we provide concise information to get you up and running with Sentry's Ember SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

**Note:** If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

Our Ember SDK currently supports all lts versions of Ember 3.x.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. Add the Ember addon using ember-cli:

```bash {tabTitle:ember-cli}
ember install @sentry/ember
```

## Configure

You should initialize the Sentry Ember SDK as soon as possible during your application load up, before initializing the
application in `app.js`:

```javascript
import Application from '@ember/application';
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver';
import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers';
import config from './config/environment';

import { InitSentryForEmber } from '@sentry/ember';

InitSentryForEmber();

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

Then add the following config to your `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  sentry: {
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
  }
};
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

**Important:** Note your DSN. The _DSN_ (Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send events. If you forget it, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in the Sentry web UI.


## Monitor Performance

Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and you’ll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues, customize queries based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

`@sentry/ember` comes with some performance monitoring enabled by default, sideloading `@sentry/tracing` as a chunk to instrument your application. If you would like to disable performance and no longer receive transactions you can set `disablePerformance` in your config.

```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  disablePerformance: true
};
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called “transactions”, which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/). To capture transactions, you must configure your SDK to set the `tracesSampleRate` configuration to a nonzero value. The default configuration will transmit 100% of captured transactions; lower this value in production to avoid consuming your quota too quickly.

### Routes
If you would like to capture timings for the `beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel` hooks as well as `setupController` in one of your Routes, `@sentry/ember` exports a `instrumentRoutePerformance` function which can be used by replacing the default export with a wrapped Route.

```javascript
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { instrumentRoutePerformance } from '@sentry/ember';

class MyRoute extends Route {
  model() {
    //...
  }
}

export default instrumentRoutePerformance(SlowLoadingRoute);
```

### Classic Components
The render times of classic components are also enabled by default, with a setting to only capture render timings above a certain duration. If you would like to change this minimum you can modify `minimumComponentRenderDuration` in your config.

```javascript
  ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
    minimumComponentRenderDuration: 0, // Setting this to zero will capture all classic components.
  };
```

If you would like to disable component instrumentation you can set `disableInstrumentComponents` in your config.
```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  disableInstrumentComponents: true
};
```

### Runloop
The duration of each queue in your application's runloop is instrumented by default, as long as the duration of the queue is longer than a threshold defined by `minimumRunloopQueueDuration` in your config.

```javascript
  ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
    minimumRunloopQueueDuration: 0, // Setting this to zero will capture all runloop queue durations
  };
```

If you would like to disable runloop instrumentation you can set `disableRunloopPerformance` in your config.
```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  disableRunloopPerformance: true
};
```
