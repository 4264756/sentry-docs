[Account preferences](https://sentry.io/settings/account/details/) provide customization of your Sentry experience like controling the frequency of your notifications. Manage your account by selecting "User settings" from the dropdown under your organizationâ€™s name.

## Security Settings

Security Settings include options to reset a password, sign out of all devices, and enable two-factor authentication.

### Two-Factor Authentication

If you cannot receive two-factor authentication codes, such as if you lose your device, use recovery codes to access your account. Click "View Codes" to download, print, or copy your codes to a secure location.

Clicking "Sign out of all devices" will end your sessions with any device logged in to Sentry using your account.

## Notifications

Notification emails send when an issue state changes, a release deploys, or there's a spike in your quota. Fine-tune notifications per project by navigating to [Workflow Notifications](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/workflow/). For more details about Notifications, see our [full documentation on Alerts & Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/).

### Email Routing

[Email Routing](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/email/) controls the emails sent for each project. These notifications default to the email address used to set up your Sentry account. Route email notifications to an alternative email address to organize your project notifications. For example, infrastructure-related projects can route to an email dedicated to your team's infrastructure.

### Weekly Reports

Sentry generates Weekly Reports per project and sends these reports once a week on Mondays. The following report sample shows details on Events Seen This Week, Events by Issue Type, Events by Project, and activity over time.

## Emails

The email address used to log into your Sentry account is, by default, your primary email address. Add an alternative email address in the Add Secondary Emails section. After verifying your secondary email, you can set it as the primary.

## Close Account

<Alert level="warning">Warning: Deleting your account cannot be undone.</Alert>

Closing your Sentry account automatically [removes all data](https://sentry.io/security/#data-removal) associated with your account after a 24-hour waiting period to prevent accidental cancellation. If your account is the sole owner of an organization, this organization will be deleted. Organizations with multiple owners will remain unchanged. For details about termination of service, see [Term, Termination, and Effect of Termination](https://sentry.io/terms/#term-termination-and-effect-of-termination).
