Sentry categorizes notifications broadly into alerts and non-alert notifications. Alerts and notifications provide visibility into the impact of errors on your users, help uncover the error type, and guide you in deciding the appropriate next step.

## Event Alerting

Alerts notify you about problems in your application and can pair with many supported Sentry [integrations](/product/integrations/). Set alerts on both issues and performance metrics.

### Issue Alerts

Issue alerting sets alerts on changes within grouped error events; also known as, issues. Create alerts for issues such as:

- Issues affecting many users
- [Events](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/) frequency
- Reoccuring events with specific [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Issue Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#issue-alerts).

### Metric Alerts

A metric alert uses the value of an aggregate function like `count()` or `avg()`. You can filter events by [attributes](/platforms/python/usage/#optional-attributes) and [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/), which is particularly useful for aggregating across events that aren't grouped into single issues. Use alerts for metrics such as:

- Latency: min, max, average, [percentile](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transaction volume](/product/performance/metrics/#frequency)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts).

## Performance Alerting

Performance empowers you to see macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/), which you can monitor with alerting.

### Metric Alerts

Metric alerts use error data to observe application usage or events that affect your user.

Create alerts for performance metrics such as:

- Latency: min, max, average, [percentile](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transaction volume](/product/performance/metrics/#frequency)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts).

## Notifications

[Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/) are all other types of Sentry signalling such as:

- **Workflow notifications**: Activity involving user actions and state changes on issues. This includes things like resolution, assignment, comments, and regressions.

- **Deploy notifications**: When a release isÂ [deployed](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#deploy), Sentry automatically sends an email to users who have committed to the release.

- **Quota & Usage notifications**: Emails about quota approaching/exceeded and spike protection

For more details, see the [full documentation on Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/).
