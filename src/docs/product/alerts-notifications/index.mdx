Sentry categorizes notifications broadly into alerts and non-alert notifications. Alerts and notifications provide visibility into the impact of errors on your users, help uncover the error type, and guide you in deciding the appropriate next step.

## Event Alerting

Alerts notify you about problems in your application and can pair with many supported Sentry [integrations](/product/integrations/). Set alerts on both issues and performance metrics.

To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Subscription](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#alert-subscription).

### Issue Alerts

Issue alerting sets alerts on changes within grouped error events; also known as, issues. Create alerts for issues such as:

- Issues affecting many users
- [Event](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/) frequency
- Reoccuring events with specific [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Issue Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#issue-alerts).

### Metric Alerts

A metric alert uses the value of an aggregate function like `count()` or `avg()`. You can filter events by [attributes](/platforms/python/usage/#optional-attributes) and [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/), which is particularly useful for aggregating across events that aren't grouped into single issues. Use alerts for metrics such as:

- Latency: min, max, average, [percentile](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transaction volume](/product/performance/metrics/#frequency)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts).

## Performance Alerting

Performance alerting monitors macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/). Set alerts on metrics impacting your user's experience, the speed of your application, etc. For more details about Performance, see the [full documentation on Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/).

To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Subscription](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#alert-subscription).

### Metric Alerts

A metric alert uses the value of an aggregate function like `count()` or `avg()`. You can filter events by [attributes](/platforms/python/usage/#optional-attributes) and [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/), which is particularly useful for aggregating across events that aren't grouped into single issues.

- Latency: min, max, average, [percentile](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transaction volume](/product/performance/metrics/#frequency)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts).

## Notifications

Notifications are emails triggered by changes in [issue state](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#issue-states), [releases](/product/releases/), and [quota usage](/accounts/quotas/). To change the frequency of your email notifications, configure your [Notification Subscription](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#notification-subscription).

Types of Sentry notifications:

- [**Workflow notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#workflow): Activity involving user actions and state changes on issues. Includes activities such as resolution, assignment, comments, and regressions.

- [**Deploy notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#deploy): When a release isÂ deployed, Sentry automatically sends an email to users who have committed to the release.

- [**Quota & Usage notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#quota): Emails about approaching quotas, exceeded quotas, and spike protection.

For more details, see the [full documentation on Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/).
