Sentry categorizes notifications broadly into alerts and non-alert notifications. Alerts and notifications provide visibility into the impact of errors on your users, help uncover the error type, and guide you in deciding the appropriate next step.

## Error Alerting

Alerts notify you about problems in your application and can be sent to many supported integrations. You can set alerts on both errors and performance data.

### Issue Alerts

Sentry automatically groups individual error events into issues based on stack trace and other factors. You can set alerts on changes in those issues (such as new issues or issues affecting many users), or on the raw events (such as frequency of events with a given tag).

For more details, see the [full documentation on Issue Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#issue-alerts).

### Metric Alerts

Use metric alerts on error data to compute the number of events or users affected by events in your project. A metric is the value of an aggregate function like `count()` or `avg()`. You can filter events by attributes and tags, which is particularly useful for aggregating across events that aren't grouped into single issues.

For more details, see the [full documentation on Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts).

## Performance Alerting

Performance empowers you to see macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/), which you can monitor with alerting.

### Metric Alerts

As discussed above, metric alerts use error data to observe application usage or events that affect your user.

Create alerts for performance metrics such as:

- Latency: min, max, average, [percentile](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transaction volume](/product/performance/metrics/#frequency)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts).

## Notifications

[Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/) are all other types of Sentry signalling such as:

- **Workflow notifications**: Activity involving user actions and state changes on issues. This includes things like resolution, assignment, comments, and regressions.

- **Deploy notifications**: When a release isÂ [deployed](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#deploy), Sentry automatically sends an email to users who have committed to the release.

- **Quota & Usage notifications**: Emails about quota approaching/exceeded and spike protection

For more details, see the [full documentation on Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/).
